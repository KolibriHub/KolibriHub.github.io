					C++ is a general purpose programming
					language and widely used now a days '
					for competitive programming. It has
					imperative, object-oriented and generic
					programming features. C++ runs on lots of
					platform like Windows, Linux, Unix, Mac etc.
					C++ is an efficient
					and powerful language and finds wide use
					in various GUI platforms, 3D graphics and
					real-time simulations. Because of the
					inclusion of rich function libraries,
					working in C++ becomes simpler and
					convenient than C. Being object-oriented
					programming like Java, C++ provides
					the support of inheritance, polymorphism,
					encapsulation, etc. Unlike C, C++ allows
					exception handling and function overloading.

				<p>he “Hello World” program is the first
					step towards learning any programming
					language and also one of the simplest
					programs you will learn. All you have
					to do is display the message “Hello World”
					on the screen.
					<br><br>Let us now look at the program :<br>
				</p>
				<br>
				<p>C++ is an Object Oriented Programming Language.
					<br> The main pillars of Object Oriented
					Programming are :
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Objects and Classes</li>
					<li>Inheritance</li>
					<li>Polymorphism</li>
					<li>Abstraction</li>
					<li>Encapsulation</li>
				</ul>

				<p>
					Object-oriented programming – As the name
					suggests uses objects in programming.
					Object-oriented programming aims to
					implement real-world entities like
					inheritance, hiding, polymorphism,
					etc in programming. The main
					aim of OOP is to bind together the data
					and the functions that operate on them
					so that no other part of the code can
					access this data except that function.
				</p>
				<p><b>Object : </b>An Object is an identifiable
					entity with some characteristics and behavior.
					An Object is an instance of a Class. When a
					class is defined, no memory is allocated but
					when it is instantiated (i.e. an
					object is created) memory is allocated.
					<br>
					<b>Class : </b>The building block of C++ that
					leads to Object-Oriented programming is a Class.
					It is a user-defined data type, which holds its
					own data members and member functions, which can
					be accessed & used by creating an instance
					of that class. A class is like a blueprint for
					an object. For Example: Consider the Class
					of Cars. There may be many cars with different
					names and brand but all of them will share
					some common properties like all of them will
					have 4 wheels, Speed Limit, Mileage range etc.
					So here, Car is the class and wheels,
					speed limits, mileage are their properties.
